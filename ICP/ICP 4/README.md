For this assignment I created each table according to it's usecase. This is mostly straightforward put statements in this form:

    put <table>, <row> ,<columnfamily:column>, <value>

Then I used several types of HBase commands to perform miscellaneous operations. Some of these operations were changing a string value to an integer value, describing a table, disabling (and re-enabling) a table and deleting a row.


Here are my first batch of tables:
