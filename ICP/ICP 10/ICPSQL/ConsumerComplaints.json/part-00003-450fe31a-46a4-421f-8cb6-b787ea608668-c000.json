XXXX XXXX placed my account into their repossession department, froze my access to my account online, which does not allow me to view the payments that are being applied to my account. In his letter, the balance that I was told was past due is {$1700.00}. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX also told me that my loan was too new to do anything, plus the value of the vehicle was not worth enough to work with me on lowering the interest or the payments. When I contacted the number that he provided, I was told that my balance was {$1900.00}, and that my loan was suspended.

I informed Chase from the very beginning that my intention was to continue to make my on time payments of my mortgage and to protect Chase and myself from any negative impact financially. My intention is to keep my credit in good standing and for Chase to avoid taking back a property worth less than the balance owed. It is my best interest to keep this home for me and my children and not cause disruption in our lives. I have demonstrated by my credit history and my income that I have the ability to make these payments and had little to no financial help from my ex-husband for the last year. If Chase is unwilling to grant me an assumption that may jeopardize my financial situation and that forces me into a bankruptcy and foreclosure because of my ex-husbands financial actions. Then Chase may have to take a home back in foreclosure that at this time is entirely avoidable. Chase did not offer any other solutions other than to find another bank. I have in fact talked to a mortgage broker and another bank. Given my credit history I can qualify for a loan but due to the loan to value and the current debt to income ratio, I will not qualify at this time with another bank.","Company":"JPMorgan Chase & Co.","State Name":"IN","Zip Code":"473XX","Consumer Consent Provided":"Consent provided","Submitted via":"Web","Date Sent to Company":"2015-05-11","Company Response to Consumer":"Closed with explanation","Timely Response":"Yes","Consumer Disputed":"No","Complaint ID":"1369215"}

The federal the courts are more protective of the banks than State court. Despite all this the federal judge granted us the opportunity to sue for fraud against WFB : Our counsel advised that it would drag on cost us a lot of money- but then WFB threatened that if we did not prevail a year or so from our filing that we would be responsible for XXXX to {$10000.00} dollars of their attorneys fees!

After repeated faxes and emails to the contact information they provided, our insurance carrier says the emails keep bouncing back, and when I call US Bank, they have no record of the fax being received, either. Several years ago, we received a very similar letter from US Bank, also stating our insurance had expired, and if we did n't provide proof of insurance, they would buy insurance for us. At that time, we did n't call US Bank, since a call to our insurance provider verified we had uninterrupted coverage for the property, and they faced a copy of the policy to US Bank. However, what we did n't realize at that time was that US Bank had changed their fax number, but did n't notify the insurance company or provide them with a new ( correct ) fax number. Because they 'never received the fax ' they charged us for the cost of US Bank purchased extra insurance, and would n't remove the policy and extra cost, even after we provided proof of continuous insurance. They added this extra cost onto our insurance, without notifying us. It was several hundred dollars more a month, for over a year. My fear is that they are going to do the same thing this time, since they have n't been able to provide a correct fax or email address to either us or our insurance carrier. Because US Bank makes a substantial profit on the sale of this type of insurance, my belief is they intentionally change their fax numbers, ensuing insurance updates do n't come through, and charging homeowners for the extra insurance.

{"Date Received":"2015-04-30","Product Name":"Mortgage","Sub Product":"Conventional fixed mortgage","Issue":"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","Consumer Complaint Narrative":"There are a couple of issues. When my mortgage ( by XXXX XXXX ) was sold a past due balance was transferred to the new mortgage company ( Nationstar Mortgage ). I spoke to Nationstar and was told repeatedly that this balance was part of a forbearance that the XXXX issued but all of the information had not been sent over yet. When it continued to appear on my statement I called and called, waited long periods of time to reach a person, having that person ask if they could place me on hold while they reviewed the account and made notations at which time the phone would begin to ring again and another person would answer and ask if they could have my loan number. This happens, at least, 4 times during each call until I am forced to hang up. In addition, they have tacked on a large amount for insurance they claim to have not been able to verify. This is incorrect. XXXX advised they sent over the insurance information and my insurance carrier said Nationstar could see if there was coverage on the home. Nationstar charges {$9.00} to make an online payment if the payment is made after the last day of the month regardless if the payment is past due or not. Past due payments are charged this fee plus a late fee. If the payment is made via phone the fee is {$19.00}. I have paid additional monies on several of my payments trying to put the mortgage a month ahead in order to avoid the online payment fees. Each month the overage is applied to the principal. When I have spoken with Nationstar they say that 's just the way it is and ca n't be undone.

I paid the final bill in XXXX. Approximately one year later I received a collection notice that I owed the cell phone company {$330.00}. I do not owe them anything. After XXXX phone calls over the past couple of years ( yes, years ) the cell phone representative discovered that a new 2 yr contract had been started in the month of XXXX or XXXX. This is completely wrong. My daughter had lost her phone, I had another phone I purchased off of XXXX, I have the receipt for this other phone. I called the cell phone company ( XXXX maybe ) to move her phone number over to this new phone I had purchased on XXXX. When the number was transferred it created a new 2 yr agreement as if I had purchased the phone from THEM, but I did not, so this XXXX 2 yr contract should never have been started, but I was completely unaware of it. I have contacted the collection agency that sent bills to me. I explained what happened and they said it was n't their job to fix it. The collection agency somehow transferred me to the cell phone company. As I was explaining it, she put me on hold and we were disconnected. I called the collection agency back the next day. Out of frustration I explained, again, about the 2 yr contract that should not have been made and I just wanted to get this done with, it had been XXXX years. Even though it was a mistake by the cell phone company I was tired of dealing with it and offered to pay a portion of the bill if that would end it. The collection agency representative agreed. I asked to have the derogatory marks removed from my credit report ( XXXX pages from this XXXX collection ). This was also agreed upon. I told her I will be making a reference to our agreement on my check because she could n't offer me anything to secure our agreement. I sent a check with a notation written on it about our agreement ( I have a copy ). So, the account was taken care of. I contacted the credit reporting agency recently and the derogatory marks were NOT removed as agreed upon. I filed a claim with the reporting agency. They told me, after the investigation, that it is all perfectly fine and will not be removed! Now, I noticed there 's also a notation at the beginning of the XXXX pages, from this XXXX collection agency, that states \"\" only half of the account was paid ''! That was our agreement!

The only asset in the trust was his vacant house. He had a balance of more than {$30000.00} with Wells Fargo on the home mortgage. There were no cash assets in the trust. I made the $ XXXX monthly payment on the house because our XXXX son wanted to be able to live there. The house could not be lived in at the time because of the repairs that needed to be done, and we could only afford minimum outlay so he was doing as much as he could himself. Then my son died in XX/XX/XXXX, and I had no use for the house, and consulted Wells Fargo to see if I could sell it. They told me I could not sell the house unless I paid it off and got a new mortgage, which I was in no position to do. I continued to make payments through XXXX of XXXX when a real estate friend of my said I should find out if I even had to make the payments, since I was not the owner and my name was neither on the house or the mortgage. I consulted an attorney who told me I had never had to make payments from my own personal money, I only was legally obligated to pay from money in the trust. Since there were never any cash assets in the trust, I had no legal responsibility to make the payments. In XXXX I stopped the automatic withdrawals from my account and informed Wells Fargo by phone that I was not making any more payments. They still withdrew the XXXX payment. I was incensed! I called and demanded they return the money to my account. I once again explained that I was the successor trustee and was not obligated to pay. The representative said \"\" Oh","Company Public Response":" it does n't say you 're the successor trustee. I 'll have the payment returned. '' Which she did. My problem is Wells Fargo had a complete copy of the trust within XXXX months of my ex-husband 's death. The trust clearly shows no cash assets.

Had Bank of America modified my loan 4 years ago, my payment would have been reduced approximately {$400.00} per month, but they have drug this out as my income has slowly increased and reducing my payment now would only result in a reduction of a few dollars - my ask is that this be done and that I be on a fixed rate loan, not an adjustable rate loan that can increase beyond my ability to pay. I have not asked for my principal to be reduced, only that my loan be modified to a fixed rate with a payment less than 31 % of my income. Delays in inaccurate calculations over the last 4 years do not seem reasonable or legal to me. I am current on my payments but fear the next increase will push the payment beyond my means.","Company Public Response":"Company chooses not to provide a public response","Company":"Bank of America","State Name":"WA","Zip Code":"981XX","Consumer Consent Provided":"Consent provided","Submitted via":"Web","Date Sent to Company":"2015-04-30","Company Response to Consumer":"Closed","Timely Response":"Yes","Consumer Disputed":"No","Complaint ID":"1355544"}

The next business day I took my card and physically went to one of Citibank 's branches in XXXX where the branch manager checked the information of my card and called their debit card department where they verified that there was an issue with the card, however according to them they solved the issue over the phone. A couple of weeks later I tried using the card again XXXX in XXXX XXXX and the card not only got declined but the merchant received a message that the card was reported stolen at such point the merchant confiscated the card and I was put through humiliating experience in front of other people. After this episode I immediately contacted customer service from overseas having to incur long distance phone expenses and additional expenses from foreign transaction fees that where charged to me by my other financial institution ( I have a Citigold account which does not charge foreign transaction fees while XXXX ), I was told by the rep on the phone that they will be overnighting a card to me to XXXX XXXX, the card arrived 4 days later at which point I was already returning to the US, so I received the card and waited two days to activated once I was back in the US. I activated the new card and tried using it and got declined again, so I called once again to the customer service number and was told that the XXXX digit code on the back of that card did not match what was on their system so they where going to be sending another card. At XX/XX/XXXX I received card number XXXX and called the customer service number to activate it and make sure all the information matched what they had in their system and the agent tells me that the code does not match again, ( sounds like a joke ) at this point I request to speak to a supervisor and get to the bottom of the issue. I spent around XXXX minutes on the phone while I am on my way to the airport on XX/XX/XXXX trying to get the issue solved with this supervisor and she assures me that by XX/XX/XXXX I will get my card at the hotel where I was going to be staying at in XXXX, FL, well no card came on Tuesday so when I received a call from Citibank to verify that the card was received I told them that no card had been received, so they sent out another card to be received on XX/XX/XXXX ( card number XXXX ). So on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX card came to the hotel and neither XXXX of the cards are the correct cards ( XXXX of them is an ATM only card and the other card does not match my account type ). I have tried to communicate with Citibank through all channels possible, including social media ( Twitter ) and everyone promises follow-ups and solutions but then nothing. I lastly requested an email address to their executive offices and was promised that I will receive such address, but it has been 4 days and no address has been received. "}

This is extortion. In contacting XXXX, I get a big run around, and, ultimately, they will not remove this false collection from my credit report. Since when do collection agencies tell the credit reporting agencies how to manage credit reports? This first complaint is against TransUnion.

{"Date Received":"2015-05-06","Product Name":"Bank account or service","Sub Product":"Other bank product/service","Issue":"Account opening, closing, or management","Consumer Complaint Narrative":"I was interested in buying a home so I went into my Wells Fargo to find out the steps I needed to take in order to do so. I had no real credit and I was advised by XXXX of their representatives to apply for a personal line of credit. I agreed and I signed a form giving my permission for them to pull from XXXX credit bureau each for my wife and I. As it turns out, they pulled from all XXXX bureaus for me and XXXX for my wife. Unfortunately, they reported the inquiry as a mortgage inquiry for XXXX of us through XXXX. This caused my XXXX score to drop by XXXX points and XXXX points for my wife. They only sent me XXXX Federal Disclosure for XXXX and they sent my wife XXXX for XXXX. I should have received XXXX since they reported to all XXXX bureaus. I only gave them permission to inquire to XXXX bureau. I then began trying to repair the situation. At XXXX Wells Fargo told me that they only pulled from XXXX bureau and they never submitted it as a mortgage loan inquiry. I then had to provide them proof that I was correct. Once I provided the proof that they had done the wrong thing, I eventually obtained a letter from the bank manager stating that I had only applied for a personal line of credit. After numerous hours of face to face discussions and hours of phone transfers, I ended up speaking with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). She told me that I needed to fax her proof that Wells Fargo had done an inquiry from all XXXX bureaus and that it had been a mortgage inquiry to XXXX At my own expense, I obtained my credit reports. I also obtained information from XXXX proving that the mortgage inquiry that Wells Fargo made had hurt our credit scores. I faxed her all of the information that pertained to my case with them. I did not sent her my entire credit report because no other information should have pertained to the situation I was having with them. I began calling after a few days to ensure that she had received the fax. She refused to answer the phone or return my messages. Finally, I did get through to her and she told me that she needed to see all of our credit reports in their entirety to be able to tell what really happened. I was uncomfortable with this, as I did not understand why she needed such detailed information from my credit reports that did not correlate with the issue at hand. However, she told me that if I did not send her all of the reports in their entirety, Wells Fargo would do absolutely nothing for me. So, I again obtained my credit reports and faxed them at my own expense. I called a few days later to see if she had received the fax and she refused to return my calls and messages. I ended up having to place a complaint about the lack of communication. After calling over the next few days, she did finally answer. She told me that she had sent the information to her manager and after discussing it, there was nothing else they could do for me. I have spent hours on the phone being transferred around trying to get this resolved. I have been spoken to very rudely, hung up on and lied to. When I am fortunate enough to get someone on the phone, all they can tell me is that they do not know what happened, they do not know what to do to fix it and that they do n't know what else they can possibly do for me. I tried to dispute this directly with the credit bureaus, but since I admitted to applying for a personal line of credit, they said there is nothing that they can do for me, even though it was mistakenly submitted as a mortgage inquiry. They told me that it had to be taken up with Wells Fargo before it could go any further. I am demanding that Wells Fargo remove all inquires from all of the credit bureaus since they clearly did the wrong thing. They only had permission to inquire from XXXX bureau each for my wife and I and they submitted the inquiries incorrectly as mortgage inquiries. Documentation enclosed. "}

He claimed that his firm had already validated the debt by using my address. I attempted to explain to him and disputed the debt was not mine. I also requested he cross reference my social security number, middle initial, any previous addresses and the phone number that is in question. He stated that his firm had already done so.

All XXXX of us log in separately to AES website to pay our individual bills. My complaint is against their customer service and their website on how the loan and billing information is displayed and how the payments are distributed. The information is misleading and the balance does not always accurately reflect a true balance. I logged in this month and the system showed me a balance which matched the exact amount that I have paid on the loans solely in my name for the past 10 years only to find out that AES applied that money to the loan my father co-signed on because his was also due. The information their website showed me did not give me any reason or indication that the money I was sending was going to be applied differently. When my father logged in to pay, his amount was less ( because my money paid part of his loan ) and now my account is delinquent. All three of us logged in and at the time of log in, satisfied the payment balance ... but their system is glitched or does n't properly show the information because the full balance was n't paid because their system never accurately showed the information. Money was sent to the wrong place and then because of it, the wrong balance was shown to my father who then paid less than he usually does ( thinking the rate changed or something happened to lower the payment ). It 's confusing. It creates undue stress and anxiety. Their system needs looked at and their customer service investigated. The supervisor, XXXX, also gave me conflicting information and admitted that she read the screen wrong. Which leads me to believe they struggle with getting accurate information out of their own system.

Property address is XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia. At the time I purchased the property, I received a XXXX loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The 80 % was a conventional loan and the 20 % was an unattached note on the account. The property went into foreclosure and was sold in XX/XX/XXXX. The 80 % was satisfied, however the 20 % part of the loan was not. The XXXX part of the loan was sold to a debt collector which is known as Real Time Resolution. The debt collector, Real Time resolution has been reporting this as a late mortgage payment every month on my credit, when I no longer own the property, instead of an account in collection. Since the creditor has been reporting this as a late mortgage payment every month, it has really affected my credit. I have reached out to the creditor directly and also disputed on my credit report, and the creditor refuses to make the necessary corrections. This is an unfair and deceptive way of reporting a debt as a mortgage debt instead of an collection, when the creditor bought the debt and is clearly identifying themselves as a debt collector. I need for the creditor to correct my credit reporting information as soon as possible.","Company":"Real Time Resolutions","State Name":"FL","Zip Code":"333XX","Consumer Consent Provided":"Consent provided","Submitted via":"Web","Date Sent to Company":"2015-05-18","Company Response to Consumer":"Closed with explanation","Timely Response":"No","Consumer Disputed":"No","Complaint ID":"1377419"}

I have tried to do the right thing in not filing suit on those grounds. It is doubtful that this loan will pass the smell test for securitization. I have worked along with Chase to modify and make arramgements that have not been in my best interest financially, and keeps me in a bind. My payments have been as high as {$4500.00} per month. ( when had variable rate ). The most recent payment arrangement that was offered to me this week is a prime example. I am already financially challenged and Chase wants a $ XXXX downpayment and ober XXXX per month. I have done extensive repairs to my home and want to keep it. It still has foundation settling that XXXX XXXX estimated in XX/XX/XXXX for over {$30000.00}. It has since gotten worse and many of my doors will not close properly and the fireplace is separating from the wall. This impacts the value and safety of my home. The value that has been placed on my property during this modification process is inflated because no one has been inside or on the grounds to see the problems. I have been disqualified unjustly for a decent modification because of false information on the appraisal. The homes in my area are older, not energy efficient and stay on the market on an average of XXXX years or more. The comps used in the value are out of my comp zone. That could be deemed as fraudulent. I really need a reduction in my balance to match the real value and a rate concurrent to market or below since there are programs from the President to help homeowners. Otherwise, this loans needs to be litigated in court to prove it is illegal and that I have overpaid all these years.","Company":"JPMorgan Chase & Co.","State Name":"NC","Zip Code":"278XX","Consumer Consent Provided":"Consent provided","Submitted via":"Web","Date Sent to Company":"2015-05-26","Company Response to Consumer":"Closed with explanation","Timely Response":"Yes","Consumer Disputed":"Yes","Complaint ID":"1390827"}

My credit card came with a promotional offer if i spent {$3000.00} in the first 90 days, I would be rewarded with XXXX miles. However, since they have effectively maxed my credit card out with a double balance transfer I of course am unable to use the card. Also, it is making my debt ratio look much higher, and potentially pulling down my credit rating.","Company Public Response":"Company chooses not to provide a public response","Company":"Barclays PLC","State Name":"CO","Zip Code":"800XX","Consumer Consent Provided":"Consent provided","Submitted via":"Web","Date Sent to Company":"2015-05-06","Company Response to Consumer":"Closed with non-monetary relief","Timely Response":"Yes","Consumer Disputed":"No","Complaint ID":"1363031"}

This would be more well enough for the line of credit I was seeking at least you would think. My father and I therefore called customer service at Chase Bank asking them to reconsider. We XXXX talked to XXXX asking her to reconsider the decline application for a line of credit. She insisted that since there was no line of credit history that they could not issue a credit card. We asked to talk to her supervisor, therefore we then talked to XXXX. XXXX gave the same explanation of not having enough credit history. XXXX gave the phone to XXXX her manager to talk about the issue. XXXX took over for XXXX. XXXX gave the same run down that XXXX gave us except we recorded the conversation that gave us the alternative to get credit. He recommended me to go to an inferior that charges more money to get credit to get credit with Chase Bank. XXXX said that it was Chase Bank 's philosophy to deny the credit card if there is no prior credit history. There is no professional judgement in further research of the individual to see if they have other means of income, its just the click of a button than says Yes or No. This philosophy happens to be trade secret, but any person with a brain would think you would want to issue a credit card to a person who can make the payments and has more than enough to cover the line of credit with liquid assets. We offered to give the statements showing that I had the assets to prove that I was a worthy candidate for the credit card, but the would not even take them or make amends. "}

{"Date Received":"2015-04-27","Product Name":"Consumer Loan","Sub Product":"Vehicle loan","Issue":"Problems when you are unable to pay","Consumer Complaint Narrative":"\"Two weeks ago I contacted Wells Fargo because I am late on my car payment. At that time the car payment was approximately 45 or so days late ( actually I do n't know the exact # because Wells Fargo would n't tell me ) but as of today I was notified of a 60 day late on my credit report. I tried to make a payment with Wells Fargo but they would not take it. I believe they wanted XXXX payments which at that time I was unable to do that but I was willing to set up a payment XXXX for the XXXX and XXXX for the XXXX which is coming up. They refused. I hung up and called back thinking I might get someone willing to work with me. They transferred me to a Manager and he said he was the only person I could talk to and he was not working with me. ( not in those exact words ) but he showed no interest in working with me or taking my payment. ( Fast forward ). I have a XXXX car garage ( tandem ; XXXX car in front XXXX in back ) but I ca n't close the garage because I have items in the front spot so XXXX car sticks out. The Manager never mentioned anything about repo and my intention was to pay the back payments this Thursday the XXXX so my intent was not to hide the car because if it were I would have parked my other car on the street and closed the garage. I park this way all the time because XXXX cars can not go all the way into the garage. Well Friday XXXX at XXXX someone came banging on my door yelling for me to give him the car. I was at home alone therefor I did not open the door. My Jetta was blocking the Toyota so the only way for him to have seen the car was to enter the garage. He continued to bang on the door making loud noises and when I finally opened the back door he was sitting in his truck blocking my garage and blocking my other car. I asked him to leave and he refused stating \"\" he will sit there all night '' he was disturbing the neighbors with the yelling and the loud noise from his truck. I eventually had to call the Sheriff 's to get him to leave. I am not sure but I could swear that the voice was the same voice of the manager I spoke with on the phone a couple of weeks ago. In my opinion it seems as though Wells Fargo employees are getting kick backs for repossessing customers cars because the voice sounded the same as the manager that would not work with me. Please investigate this because if that is what they are doing Wells Fargo needs to be aware of this practice. Also","Company Public Response":" I am not sure if a repo man can come bang on your door at XXXX and demand that you give him the car. I do n't know the rules .I want to call Wells Fargo to try and work something out but I am afraid that that same person will answer the phone. I simply want to know my options so I can decide if I want to keep the car or turn it in. In addition Wells Fargo put insurance on the loan for a month but have spread the payments over the deration of the loan ; meaning I am paying 13 % interest on the insurance because I am paying 13 % interest on the loan. It 's bad enough that the car only cost XXXX and I have been paying it since 2011 and I still owe XXXX.

We own a home in XXXX and decided to rent it out. With the cost of moving, difficulty finding a tenant, and the financial burden of unemployment of my long time partner and father of my children, we found ourselves XXXX payments behind on our mortgage. Chase Bank, my mortgage company, referred us to a loan specialist who recommended a loan modification. At that point, I was left with no other options as they would not accept XXXX payment, only XXXX, to bring the loan current. They also assured me this was in my best interest for our current situation, considering we were in financial distress and likely would be for several more months. I admit, the idea of a reduced mortgage payment for 6-12 months was appealing. We were sinking and needed the financial relief. I did not know that this process would lead to 7 months of unending stress, nor did I know my house would go into foreclosure. I was told this would keep my house out of foreclosure. And that was just XXXX of several instances of total misinformation. Others include : 1. Chase does not refer to a loan specialist until XXXX payments behind ; we were XXXX. 2. We have a XXXX and the house is not our primary residence. This was discussed in the XXXX conversation with the specialist. This fact disqualifies us for a modification, yet Chase allowed the process to begin and continue for 6 months. 3. The whole process was very disorganized. I only spoke with my assigned loan specialist about XXXX times. She was never available so I spoke with someone different every time, each of which requested different documents and information. 4.

After my bankruptcy is discharged, the repayment of the loan is started again. Now I was discharged XXXX of XXXX. In late XXXX of XXXX I was contacted by a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX . The company is a debt collection agency representing XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX they did n't offer to prove that the loan is mine and if the amount that they claim that I owe is even correct. We did though come to an agreement for me to pay XXXX XXXX and XXXX dollars every other Friday, which means in a years time I would be one month ahead of scheduled payments. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I made the XXXX full payment of XXXX dollars. XXXX weeks later on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the XXXX dollars every other week started. I made every payment that they wanted me to make with no issues. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was the last payment that they would take from me. Approximately a week later a company called Blitt and Gaines PC Contacts me, wanting me to start voluntarily start paying on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told them that I am already repaying my loan with another company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). After they contacted me, I turned around and contacted XXXX system. They told me everything is fine and im still on schedule to keep making scheduled payments every other week. After that was all said and done I did n't think anything of the situation. XXXX weeks and went by and it was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I checked my account to see if the payment of XXXX dollars has been withdrew from my account. It turns out that the payment was not taken from me. I look closer and find that two weeks before this time on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that the payment was n't accepted then either. I contact XXXX systems to find out why the payment was n't received. They tell me that the account has been closed and I have to call this particular number. I call the number which is for the national collegiate trust people. XXXX now tells me that I have to contact Blitt and Gaines Law firm. I contacted them and now they wanted me to pay more a month that was already agreed upon with the other Company XXXX. I told them that I could n't afford the payment of XXXX dollars a month. It was already hard enough to pay XXXX dollars a month as it was.

They do on the other hand keep contacting me instead of him which I know is a violation of my rights.

{"Date Received":"The reason this account was left open with the balance was that US Bank sent me a promotional email titled \"\" {$5.00} For XXXX ''.

{"Date Received":"2015-04-27","Product Name":"Mortgage","Sub Product":"Conventional fixed mortgage","Issue":"Application, originator, mortgage broker","Consumer Complaint Narrative":"Previous lender ( XXXX ) offered mortgage rate reduction service for a fee % of outstanding balance with a maximum of {$1500.00}. I wanted to open my new mortgage with USAA because I liked them for banking however I would only switch if this service were offered. When I started the process of buying a new house this summer I confirmed with my USAA processor that USAA offered a similar service to that of my previous lender. Because of this I opened a loan with USAAIn XXXX of XX/XX/2014 seeing that rates dropped I contacted USAA mortgage department to reduce my rate. XXXX XXXX said that this was not a service which USAA offers but they could handle it through the loss mitigation department. I talked to several people in the loss mitigation department because I thought this was the wrong department. Every person I talked to said that loss mitigation was the correct department, even though I was not at risk of defaulting. They said I just had to fill out the paperwork and jump through the hoops and I would be able to reduce my rate. After submitting all the paperwork, on the final step of my processing, my loss mitigation processor XXXX told me that a loss mitigation was the incorrect service for my situation. He sent me to XXXX XXXX who I talked with and we decided the best solution would be for me to do a mortgage refinance and have USAA cover/offset some of the costs. I was forwarded to XXXX XXXX, of USAA Mortgage to handle this, who then sent me back to loss mitigation who then sent me back to XXXX at USAA Mortgage. Each department will not handle my rate reduction and says the other department is responsible. They will just send me back and forth with no resolution. "}
